# Boba for Android SDK

Boba for Android SDK: Develop IPC extension applications for the `Boba for Android` project or your 
own Android application. 

SDK provides mechanism for application extensibility through the development of IPC 
Extensions applications.

The Client and the Extension application talk to each other using the IPC so the additional 
extensibility is exposed. Client sends the request, Extension acts upon it and responds.

## IPC SDK Protocol

The communication protocol is described [here](Android/Documentation/Protocol/Protocol.md).

## Current state of the project

The current state of the SDK and development progress is documented [here](Android/Documentation/Work/Current.md).
